## Proof-of-Storage

Many blockchain networks are underpinned by the notion that
constituent nodes supply something of value to the blockchain - 
a contribution that is hard to fake, but which, if actually made,
can be trivially verified. Typically, this takes the form of a
probabilistic argument, rather than a concrete proof; that is,
it might _technically_ be possible to convince other nodes that
one is making a contribution one is not, but the possibility is
so vanishingly slight as to border on impossibility.

Blockchains based in this approach are often said to require
"Proof-of-_X_", where _X_ is the valued contribution. The
Filecoin blockchain values contributions of storage capacity; it
is predicated upon a novel Proof-of-Storage construction,
distinguishing it from other blockchains that, as is most often
the case, require a contribution of computing power.

As a term, Proof-of-Storage refers to the design elements of the
Filecoin protocol that allow one to guarantee (to some very high
tolerance) that nodes that claim to be contributing a given
amount of storage are indeed fulfilling that pledge. In fact,
Filecoin's Proof-of-Storage construction provides for a much
stronger claim, allowing one to efficiently verify that a node is
storing a _particular file_, without requiring that one have a
copy of the file itself.
