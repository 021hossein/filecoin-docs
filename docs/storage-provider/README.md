# Provide

Welcome to the Filecoin documentation for **Storage Providers**.

{{ $frontmatter.description }} Content in this section will help you to:

- Understand [how storgae providing works](how-storage-works.md) and what different types of providers exist.
- Learn how storage providers get [rewards](storage-rewards.md) when doing their job properly, but also [slashed](slashing.md) when they are unable to honor deals they have made.
- Learn about different [storage architectures](architectures.md).
- Setup and run a high performant [Lotus Storage Provider](https://lotus.filecoin.io/docs/storage-providers/overview/).

The documentation you will be reading assumes you are familiar with the documentation in the [Get started](../get-started) section, have a general grasp of how Filecoin works and are familiar with Filecoin node software and tooling.

:::warning
Running a successful storage provisioning operation on Filecoin has high [hardware requirements](hardware-requirements.md) and, apart from a strong familiarity with Filecoin, requires experience in systems deployment and administration.
