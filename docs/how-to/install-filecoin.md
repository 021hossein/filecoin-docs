# Install Filecoin

Filecoin currently has 2 full-node, command-line implementations:

- [lotus](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus) (Go) 
  - [Tutorial to install lotus](https://docs.lotu.sh/)
- [go-filecoin](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-filecoin) (Go) 
  - [Tutorial to install go-filecoin](https://docs.filecoin.io/go-filecoin-tutorial/Home.html)

For more ways to install and use Filecoin, including user-friendly graphical interfaces and JavaScript API clients, see [Community Resources](https://github.com/filecoin-project/docs/wiki#community-resources).

### Before you begin:

We recommend a dedicated computer that can be left running and connected to the network. If you don’t have a dedicated computer for this, you can use a remote server such as Digital Ocean. Here’s a starter configuration we use:

- Type: Standard
- CPU Type: Shared CPU
- vCPUs: 4 vCPUs
- Memory: 8 GB
- SSD: 160 GB
- Transfer: 5 TB

If you plan to mine (sell storage to others), see [Testnet Storage Mining](https://filecoin.io/blog/filecoin-testnet-mining/) for additional hardware specifications.
