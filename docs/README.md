# Filecoin Documentation

**Filecoin is a peer-to-peer network that stores files on the internet, with built-in economic incentives to ensure files are stored reliably over time.**

Available storage and pricing is not controlled by any single company. Instead, Filecoin facilitates open markets for storing and retrieving files that anyone can participate in.

There are many ways to participate in the Filecoin network, and several libraries, tools, products, and services to choose from. You can start by checking out the pathways in the page below, or by exploring the main site menu to [learn about Filecoin](/introduction), work through our [guides](/how-to) and [examples](), or utilize our API and CLI references, among other resources.
