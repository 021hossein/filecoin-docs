## Denominations of Filecoin

Much like how a US penny represents a fraction of a US dollar, there are many ways to represent value using Filecoin. This is because some actions on the Filecoin network require substantially less value than 1 whole `FIL`. The different denominations of `FIL` are:

| Name     | Decimal             |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| FIL      | 1                   |
| milliFIL | 1000                |
| microFIL | 1000000             |
| nanoFIL  | 1000000000          |
| picoFIL  | 1000000000000       |
| femtoFIL | 1000000000000000    |
| attoFIL  | 1000000000000000000 |

## Wallets

Wallets allow you to manage your assets without having to deal with a Filecoin node directly.
