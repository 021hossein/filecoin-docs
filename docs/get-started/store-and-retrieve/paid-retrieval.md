# Paid retrieval

When you store data with a storage provider, you must pay to have your data stored. Similarly, when you want to retrieve your data back from the storage provider, you must pay a retrieval fee. This fee covers the expenses of unsealing your data and sending it back to you! This page covers the end-to-end process of paid retrieval.

This page covers the following steps:

1. Get your public address from your Lotus node.
1. Find an exchange to buy FIL from.
1. Send FIL from your exchange to your public address.
1. Get your deal information from `filecoin.tools`. 
1. Send a retrieval request to get your data.

:::tip Free retrieval
It will soon be possible to retrieve data back from a storage provider for free, with some caveats. However, that process is still under development.

## Things to note

As you're going through this section, make a note of the following variables:

| Variable | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Your public address | The public part of your Filecoin address. | `bafk2bzaceajz56zudni2hli7id6jvvpo5n4wj5eoxm5xwj2ipthwc2pkgowwu` |
| Provider ID | The unique identifer for each a storage provider. This is sometimes called a _Miner ID_. | `f01000` | 
| Piece CID | The CID of the data that you originally stored when you made your storage deal. | `baga6ea4seaqelwsq2q4z7utvxdwpunid773rwxfzkvxckmr3nvztssczmkux2fi` |

## Get your public address

1. Reconnect to your Lotus lite-node if you disconnected or closed the terminal since completing the previous page:

    ```shell
    FULLNODE_API_INFO=wss://api.chain.love lotus daemon --lite
    ```

    This command will continue to run. Enter any following commands in a new terminal window.

1. List all the addresses on this Lotus lite-node:

    ```shell
    lotus wallet list

    > Address                                    Balance  Nonce  Default  
    > f16mwizoeloamhp4dea4uy367mlihddw2mflnb5vy  0 FIL    0      X  
    ```

1. Make a note of your address `f16mw...`. We'll be using it in a later step.

## Purchase FIL from an exchange 

A cryptocurrency exchange, or simply just _exchange_ is a service that lets you swap cash for cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency for cash, or even one cryptocurrency for another cryptocurrency. They work similarly to currency exchanges that you find at airports, where you can swap your home currency for one of the countries you are traveling to. If you have purchased cryptocurrency before, you have likely used an exchange before.

There are lots of exchanges that allow users to buy, sell, and trade FIL. Websites like [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/filecoin/markets/) keep track of which exchanges support which cryptocurrencies. You can use these lists to help make a decision on which exchange to use.

![Coinmarketcap show a list of exchanges that support FIL.](./images/coinmarketcap-exchanges.png)

Once you have found an exchange you want to use, you will have to create an account with that exchange. Many changes have strict verification and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) processes in place, so it may take a few days to create your account. However, most large exchanges are able to verify your information in a few minutes.

Purchasing cryptocurrency varies from exchange to exchange, but the process is usually something like this:

1. Add funds to your exchange account in your local currency (USD, EUR, YEN, etc.).
1. Exchange your local currency for FIL at a set price.

## Send FIL from your exchange

Once you have FIL in your exchange account, you should be able to send some to the public address you made with your Lotus node. Again, the process for this is different for every exchange, but in general, it goes something like:

1. Submit a withdrawal request with the exchange, including:
    - How much FIL you would like to withdraw.
    - Where you want the FIL to be sent to. This value should be the public address `f16mwi...` you made with your Lotus node.
1. Wait for the withdrawal to finish.

Some exchanges place a limit on how much you can withdraw at once. The exchange may also place a time-lock on your withdrawal.

Once the withdrawal from your exchange completes, and the Filecoin network processes the transaction, you will be able to see the funds in your Lotus address by using `lotus wallet list`:

```shell
lotus wallet list

> Address                                    Balance  Nonce  Default  
> f16mwizoeloamhp4dea4uy367mlihddw2mflnb5vy  10 FIL   0      X
```

It may take a few minutes for your FIL to show up in your Lotus address. If you do not see the FIL in your Lotus address 30 minutes after the withdrawal is complete from your exchange, get in touch with your exchange's support team for help.

## Get storage deal information

Now that you have FIL in your Lotus address for the retrieval, you just need to grab the information from the storage deal you originally made. You need two pieces of information to retrieve data from a miner:

- The _Piece CID_, sometimes called the _label_. This is the content identifier for all the data stored in a single deal.
- The _Provider ID_ with whom you made to original deal to store the data. This is sometimes called the _Storage Provider ID_ or _Miner ID_. 

The [filecoin.tools](https://filecoin.tools) website shows information on Filecoin miners, clients, deals, and addresses. You can use it to find out pretty much anything happening on the Filecoin network. We're going to use it to find our past deals.

1. Copy your public address to your clipboard. If you are connect to a Lotus node you can view your public address by running `lotus wallet list`:

    ```shell
    lotus wallet list

    # Address                                    Balance  Nonce  Default  
    # f136b5uqa73jni2rr745d3nek4uw6qiy6b6zmmvcq  10 FIL   0      X  
    ```

1. Go to [filecoin.tools](https://filecoin.tools).
1. Paste your public address in the search bar and press `ENTER â†µ` to search:

    ![The Filecoin Tools website showing a list of deals from their associated address.](./images/filecoin-tools-search.png)

1. Click on one of the rows to view the details of that deal:

    ![The Filecoin Tools website showing details of a particular deal.](./images/filecoin-tools-details.png)

1. Make a note of the `Piece CID` and the `Miner ID`. We're going to use these in the next step.

    :::tip
    The `Miner ID` is also called the `Provider ID`. We'll be referring to it as the `Provider ID` in this tutorial. 
    :::

You can now move onto creating a retrieval request.

## Create a retrieval request

The retrieval command is fairly simple. We just need to add the _Provider ID_ and _Piece CID_ we got from the previous step and where we want to save the downloaded file.

1. Use the `retrieve` command to request data from a miner:

    ```shell
    lotus client retrieve --miner <PROVIDER ID> <PIECE CID> ~/output-file
    ```

    Replace `<PROVIDER ID>` and `<PIECE CID>` in the above command with your _Provider ID_ and _Piece CID_, respectively. For example:

    ```shell
    lotus client retrieve --miner f02147 baga6ea4seaqelwsq2q4z7utvxdwpunid773rwxfzkvxckmr3nvztssczmkux2fi ~/output-file
    ```

1. After submitting the `retrieve` command, your Lotus lite-node will send the retrieval deal to the storage provider and wait for a response:

    ```shell
    > Recv: 0 B, Paid 0 FIL, ClientEventOpen (DealStatusNew)
    > Recv: 0 B, Paid 0 FIL, ClientEventDealProposed (DealStatusWaitForAcceptance)
    > Recv: 120 B, Paid 0 FIL, ClientEventBlocksReceived (DealStatusWaitForAcceptance)
    > ...
    ```

    This can take some time, depending on how congested the network is and how much load this storage provider is under. You must keep the `lotus daemon` running. Once the request has been received and processed by the storage provider, your Lotus lite-node will start downloading the data to your computer.

1. Wait for the download to complete. Again, the speed of this process depends on your connection to the miner and the size of your download. When creating this tutorial, it took us around 3 minutes to download a 5GB file from a miner.
1. Once the download is complete, you should have a file in your home directory called `output-file`.

And that's it! You have just completed a paid retrieval of a file stored on the Filecoin network.
