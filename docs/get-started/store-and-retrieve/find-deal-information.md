# Find deal information

There are different ways to find information for a particular deal. Each method has benefits and drawbacks, depending on your situation. In this tutorial series, we're going to use a service called filecoin.tools.

## Using filecoin.tools

The filecoin.tool website shows information on Filecoin miners, clients, deals, and addresses. You can use it to find out pretty much anything happening on the Filecoin network. We're going to use it to find our past deals.

1. Copy your public address to your clipboard. If you are connect to a Lotus node you can view your public address by using `lotus wallet list`:


    ```shell
    lotus wallet list

    # Address                                    Balance  Nonce  Default  
    # f136b5uqa73jni2rr745d3nek4uw6qiy6b6zmmvcq  10 FIL   0      X  
    ```

1. Go to [filecoin.tools](https://filecoin.tools).
1. Paste your public address in the search bar and press `enter` to search:
