# Find deal information

There are different ways to find information for a particular deal. Each method has benefits and drawbacks, depending on your situation. This page covers using the `filecoin.tools` website, and also using Lotus to find your deals. 

## Using `filecoin.tools`

The filecoin.tool website shows information on Filecoin miners, clients, deals, and addresses. You can use it to find out pretty much anything happening on the Filecoin network. We're going to use it to find our past deals. The easiest way to find deal information using this site is by searching for your **deal CID**, but you can also find deal information using your **address**.

### Using the **deal CID**

When you create a deal with Filecoin, you get given a **deal CID** once it has been submitted:

```shell
lotus client deal

> Data CID (from lotus client import): bafykbzaced6cquoemdi6ulw5pb5jmk4ntmhf3pc3pjtdj2bp75bd7gzo5bnu2
> Deal duration (days): 180
> Miner Addresses (f0.. f0..), none to find: f0127896
> Accept (yes/no): yes
> .. executing
> Deal (f0127896) CID: bafyreicakh7ebjzoqzzue4sthcgok4y3e4te4pl5wu7kr7jfjrkfvzyw34
```

You can use this **deal CID** `bafyreica...` to find your deal information.

1. Go to [filecoin.tools](https://filecoin.tools).
1. Enter your **deal CID** into the search bar and press `ENTER â†µ` to search:

    ```
