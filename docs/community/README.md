# Community

Filecoin is home to a vibrant, diverse community of thousands of contributors and miners from all over the globe! Here's how to get help, support, or just hang out with other folks who are helping to build the distributed web.

## Ways to contribute

No matter your area of specialty or level of expertise, there are many [ways to contribute](/community/contribute/ways-to-contribute/) to Filecoin and make a real difference in the Filecoin community at large.

## IPFS forums

The official [Filecoin forums](https://discuss.filecoin.io/) are the primary home of Filecoin-related discussion. Join the conversation on [https://discuss.filecoin.io/](https://discuss.filecoin.io/) for everything from technical questions and project brainstorming to discussion of Filecoin use cases and more.

## IRC

IRC fan? Here how to [get connected](/chat-and-discussion-forums). New to IRC? There's getting-started advice for you here, too.

## Community video calls

TODO: Are there any calls to list here????

As an open-source project, most IPFS planning and synchronous discussion happens in open community video calls. Check the [IPFS community calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=ipfs.io_eal36ugu5e75s207gfjcu0ae84@group.calendar.google.com) for all recurring and one-off public calls, and join in the conversation!

## ProtoSchool chapters

ProtoSchool isn't just home to interactive tutorials on DWeb topics â€” it's also a vibrant community of makers and do-ers around the globe! Community groups worldwide host [ProtoSchool workshops](https://proto.school/#/events) regularly, offering you the opportunity to complete our interactive tutorials with the support of local mentors.

## Meetups
