# Chat & Discussion Forums

The Filecoin community is active and here to answer your questions in your channel of choice.

## Discussion Forums

For long-lived discussions and for support, please use the discussion forums at [https://discuss.filecoin.io/](https://discuss.filecoin.io/) instead of IRC or Slack! It’s easy for complex discussions to get lost in a sea of new messages on IRC, and posting longer discussions and support requests on the forums helps future visitors, too.

## Slack

Join us on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/filecoinproject/shared_invite/enQtNTUwNTI1Mzk5MDYwLTY4YmFjMzRlZjFiNDc0NmI2N2JjMjk5YTAyMDUyODljODg3MGI0ZGRhZTI5ZDNkZTAyNjkyMzI1ODM1YjA1MWI) for short-term chatter on **TODO: X, Y, and Z**.

## Internet Relay Chat (IRC)

If IRC is your chat method of choice, join [#filecoin on matrix.org](https://riot.im/app/#/group/+filecoin:matrix.org) for community chat and discussion on Filecoin usage and development.

## Getting started with IRC

If you’re new to IRC, there are _lots_ of mobile and desktop clients for working with it. Here are a few to get you started:
