# Overview

In this tutorial, we will build a simple pinning service using [Powergate](../../core-products/powergate).

A pinning service is a remote service that helps you manage your data (like a decentralized Google Drive). In this tutorial's context, the data will be managed on Filecoin & IPFS.

After completing this tutorial, you will be able to:

1. Setup your own Powergate node.
2. Interact with Powergate using Powergate JS Client (@textile/powergate-client)
3. Create a simple pinning service that manages data for multiple users on IPFS & Filecoin.
