# Step 3 - Run the Hub Auth Server

## Requirements

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. [Xcode CommandLineTools](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2339/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40014588-CH1-WHAT_IS_THE_COMMAND_LINE_TOOLS_PACKAGE_)

## Steps

Before starting the setup for the authentication server, you need to create API credentials to access the endpoints of the remote Textile hub.

To do that, youâ€™ll need:

- [An account](https://docs.textile.io/hub/accounts/). This is your developer account on the Hub.
- [A user group key](https://docs.textile.io/hub/app-apis/). This is how your users will be able to access your Hub APIs. Consider creating the key in an organization, not as your personal account, so that you can invite collaborators later. You only need to create one _user group key_ for all the users of your app.
- [Typescript](https://webpack.js.org/guides/typescript/). The server is written in typescript.

Once you have set up these resources, you can start the server. The directions below walk you through this process.

1. Create an Account

Follow the [Textile documentation](https://docs.textile.io/hub/accounts/) to download, install, and initialize the latest Hub CLI.

2. Create a user group key

After you have successfully installed the Hub CLI, run the following command to create a user group key for your org:

```bash
hub keys create --org company-name
```

1. You will be prompted to select either `account` or `user group`. Select the `user group`.
2. If everything goes as expected, you will receive a `KEY` and a `SECRET`.
3. **Copy and save these details somewhere safe**. You will need them to start the authentication server.

**Do not share any API Key Secrets. This includes User Group Key secret and Account key Secrets. Be sure you never commit them into public repos or share them in published apps.**

3. Install Typescript

Run the following command to install typescript:

```bash
npm i -g typescript
```

Linux and Mac users will have to use sudo

4. Clone the Hub Auth Server app:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/meme-marketplace
```

5. Open the [meme-marketplace](https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/meme-marketplace) project in a text editor.

6. Start the Server

Now that the resources are set up, you can start the server.

Run the following command to create a copy of _example.env_ file:

```bash
cp example.env .env
```

Replace the `your_api_key` and `your_api_secret` with `KEY` and `SECRET` generated by the hub CLI.

Run the following command to start the server:

```bash
npm run start:server
```

The server is now set up. The rest of this tutorial shows the functionality available in the Meme Marketplace app.

3. Run the following commands to start the app:

```bash
cd hub-browser-auth-app
npm install
npm start
```

The hub auth server starts.
