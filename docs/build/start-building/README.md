# Start buiding

Jump into building your Filecoin application by following this simple workflow.

## Get a node

All requests to the Filecoin network must go through a Filecoin node. You can either manage a node yourself, or use a hosting service.

## Ping the node

Make sure you can access the network by _pinging_ the node.

## Create a request

To interact with the Filecoin network you must _package_ your request properly. The basic process to creating a request is:

1. Create an account.
2. Package a request.
3. Sign the request using your account.
4. Get gas money to pay for the network to process your request.
5. Send the signed request to the network.

## Deal with the response

Once you've got a response from the network you can carry on with your application.

## Nodes

A Filecoin node is kind of like the router in your home network. When you send a request to the internet to view this website, it must first pass through your home router. Your router makes sure the request your sending is correctly packaged and structured before sending it off to the network. This is what Filecoin nodes do. When your application requests information about a transaction from the Filecoin network, it sends that request to a Filecoin node. That Filecoin node then either replies with the answer, and pings your request off to another node that might know the answer.
