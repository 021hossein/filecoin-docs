# New Filecoin Docs Site (WORK IN PROGRESS)

This repo is a **work in progress** by the Filecoin Storage & Dev Tools team, building off of the work done in [VuePress](https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress) by the IPFS Docs team to create their new [spiffy new IPFS docs site](https://docs-beta.ipfs.io/) (in beta).

**Please visit [docs.filecoin.io](https://docs.filecoin.io/) to reference current documentation.**
